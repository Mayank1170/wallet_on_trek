# Require a specific version of moon while running commands, otherwise fail.
# This ensures that all team members or CI environments use the same version.
# Uncomment and update the versionConstraint to enforce version consistency.
# versionConstraint: '>=1.0.0'

# Extend and inherit an external configuration file. Useful for sharing configs across projects.
# Must be a valid HTTPS URL or file system path.
# extends: 'https://example.com/shared/workspace.yml'

# REQUIRED: Define the projects within the workspace. This can be a map of project IDs to paths,
# or a list of filesystem globs that match multiple project directories.
projects:
  apps:
    # Path to the apps directory, where each subdirectory is considered a separate project
    path: 'apps/*'
  packages:
    # Path to the packages directory, for shared libraries or utilities used by multiple apps
    path: 'packages/*'

# Define global scripts that can be run from the workspace root. These scripts can leverage
# moon's powerful task running capabilities to perform actions across multiple projects.
scripts:
  # Example: Build all projects
  build:
    run: 'moon build'
  # Example: Test all projects
  test:
    run: 'moon test'

# Advanced configuration options can also be added here, such as custom task runners, environment
# variables, and more, depending on your project's needs.
